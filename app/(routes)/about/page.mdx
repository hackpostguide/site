# A Collection of Resources & Guides to Help you Win Your Next Hackathon ðŸš€

Hackpost Guide is a free collection of community-made resources developed to consolidate resources for hackathons and to foster a community passionate about creating apps, games, websites, and projects. It is inspired by scratch.mit.edu and dev.to. It is open source and still under development. 

Hackpost Guide promotes creativity and innovation, collaboration, and equity in computing.

This project is still very much a work in progress and in its early stages.
