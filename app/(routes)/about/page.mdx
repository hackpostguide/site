# About Hackpost Guide ðŸš€

## A Collection of Resources & Guides to Help you Win Your Next Hackathon

Hackpost Guide is a free, creative platform filled with community-created resources specifically designed for hackathon preparation. It aims to encourage youth participation in hackathons and foster a community excited about creative hacking. 
## Our Mission

Hackpost Guide was founded to address the pervasive inequality in access to education and the growing socioeconomic gaps, particularly for the youth in developing countries who lack opportunities in tech. Our mission is to encourage and facilitate participation in hackathons while equipping young minds with essential skills for their future success.

Our organization is committed to democratizing education by offering a wide array of free resources to everyone. Learning how to code and developing problem-solving abilities are among the most essential skills needed in the 21st century. We believe that engaging in hackathons is the most effective way to cultivate these skills. By providing high-quality and accessible resources, we aim to empower the next generation of leaders and innovators who will shape the future. Our vision is to bridge the educational divide and create a more inclusive world where every young individual has the opportunity to thrive and contribute meaningfully to society.

## Our Values

- **Promote Creativity and Innovation**: We offer a space to explore new ideas and technologies.

- **Encourage Collaboration**: We connect a diverse community of developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts to share knowledge and work together.

- **Support Equity in Computing**: We strive to make computing accessible to everyone, regardless of background or experience.

## We are Open source
