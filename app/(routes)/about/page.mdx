# Your Guide to Winning Your Next Hackathon ðŸš€

Hackpost Guide promotes creativity and innovation, collaboration, and equity in computing.

As you explore, please ensure you follow the community guidelines and maintain a positive and respectful environment, following our [community guidelines](https://www.hackpost.guide/community-guidelines).

### Known Bugs

Sometimes, the homepage and explore page do not render; instead, an <i>Application error: a client-side exception has occurred</i> appears, indicating a problem with hydration (<i>Minified React error #423</i>) along with a <i>TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'parallelRouterKey' of 'param' as it is null</i>. This bug is still present and being addressed. For now, simply reloading the page will often solve the issue. If you would like to assist, please visit our GitHub repository.
