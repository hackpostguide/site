      This project was developed to consolidate resources for hackathons and foster a community passionate about creating various things - apps, games, websites, and more. The resource hub is designed to resemble scratch.mit.edu and dev.to. We look forward to seeing your contributions to this expanding community!
      <br />
      This project was made using Next JS, Firebase, and Next UI. It is hosted on Vercel.
